SLUG Mailing Lists
==================

<div class="block">
The SLUG mailing lists have been created as a service to, and in support
of, members of the Suncoast Linux Users Group.  **Note: no one is
automatically subscribed to these lists, unless you specifically request
this on your New Member Survey!**

The following lists are available to the SLUG membership at large:

-   [SLUG Announce][slug-announce]\
    For group announcements.
-   [SLUG List][slug-list]\
    For normal technical assistance and Linux/computer-related topics.
-   [SLUG Politics][slug-politics]\
    For topics too hot for the SLUG list.

You can review the **[rules][list-rules]** for the lists.

[Instructions][list-instructions] for posting, subscribing and
unsubscribing.

[Find out][list-subscribe-unsubscribe] if you're already subscribed or
unsubscribed.
