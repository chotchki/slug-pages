Synopsis
--------

<div class="block">
Hacking Sessions are an excuse to hang out a coffee shop (or bakery)
with other geeks of the programming persuasion and write code.
Originally we were going to limit this to "new projects", but as that is
unreasonable, anything goes. However, it would be cool if you posted
links (to mailing lists/facebook/twitter/etc) of what you did during the
session.

Project Ideas
-------------

<div class="block">
1.  A presentation/talk submission system (that could be integrated into
    Upset)
2.  An RSS Feed for the SLUG mailing list. Dylan wrote one a while ago,
    but it was sort of hacky. Chotchki attempted to write one at the
    first hacking session but it was unreleased and unfinished.

Teams
-----

<div class="block">
For the sake of this event, we refer to "teams", which might only have
one member, but may also have other members. Each team must have a
unique, humorous name.

Teams should be decided by language/toolset, and should choose **one**
and only **one** project, which may or may not be in the above list.
Teams should make some reasonable effort not to duplicate the same work
as another team. Multiple "solutions" to the same problem are accept
(and perhaps expected) so long as a different language/toolset is used.
