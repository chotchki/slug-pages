# SLUG IRC Channel

The primary online meeting place for slug is irc.suncoastlug.org, port 6697 using SSL. All connections
to this 4-server IRC network require SSL and the server makes an effort to reveal identifiable information to other users (such as IP addresses, realname field,
or idle time). *Note:* that the server admins can still the IP address you are connecting from, so consider using a tor proxy or similar.
